# Calendar Event Manager

## What I Learned

This project helped me understand and practice several fundamental web development concepts:

- Working with the Document Object Model (DOM) to create dynamic web pages
- Handling form submissions and user input validation
- Managing data using browser's localStorage for data persistence
- Creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data in JavaScript
- Basic event handling and DOM manipulation
- Working with dates and time in JavaScript
- Simple CSS styling and responsive design

## How It Works

This is a simple calendar event manager where you can:
- Add new events with a title, date, and time
- See all your saved events
- Edit event details
- Delete events you don't need anymore
- Filter events by month

All your events are saved in your browser's localStorage, so they'll still be there when you close and reopen the page!
