# Simple Expense Tracker

A basic expense tracking web application built to learn and practice fundamental JavaScript concepts. This project was created as part of my journey to understand web development basics.

## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on learning:

- DOM Manipulation (selecting and updating HTML elements)
- Event Handling (form submissions and button clicks)
- Local Storage (saving data in the browser)
- Basic Form Validation
- Array Methods (map, filter, reduce)
- JavaScript Functions and Variables

## How It Works

The app lets you:
- Add expenses with descriptions, amounts, and categories
- View a list of all expenses
- Delete expenses you don't want
- See the total amount spent
- Data persists in your browser using localStorage

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The main HTML file
- `styles.css` - Basic styling for the app
- `js/app.js` - All the JavaScript code that makes things work
