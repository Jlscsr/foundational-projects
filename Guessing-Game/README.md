## What I Learned
- Working with DOM manipulation for dynamic UI updates
- Implementing game logic with JavaScript
- Managing game states and timers
- Handling user input and validation
- Creating responsive design with CSS

## How It Works
This is an interactive number guessing game that includes:
- Multiple difficulty levels with different time limits
- Random number generation within specified ranges
- Real-time feedback on guesses (too high/low)
- Score tracking system
- Timer countdown display
