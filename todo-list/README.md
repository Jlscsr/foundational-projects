# Simple Todo List

## What I Learned
In this project, I learned and practiced several fundamental web development concepts:
- Basic JavaScript DOM manipulation (selecting elements, creating elements)
- Working with HTML forms and user input
- Event handling (click events, keyboard events)
- Using localStorage to save data in the browser
- Basic CSS styling and flexbox layout
- Simple error handling with try/catch

## How It Works
This is a straightforward todo list app where you can:
1. Add new tasks by typing and clicking 'Add Task' or pressing Enter
2. Mark tasks as complete by checking the checkbox
3. Delete tasks you don't need anymore
4. Your tasks are saved in the browser, so they'll still be there when you come back

## Project Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file with the app structure
- `styles.css`: Contains all the styling to make the app look nice
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file that makes everything work
