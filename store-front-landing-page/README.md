# Store Front Landing Page

## What I Learned
- How to create a responsive layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox
- Working with CSS media queries for mobile-friendly design
- Styling navigation menus and creating hero sections
- Using CSS pseudo-elements for overlay effects
- Basic CSS animations and transitions

## How It Works
This is a static landing page for a store front that includes:
- A responsive navigation header
- A full-screen hero section with background image
- A grid layout for featured products
- A footer with contact information and social links

## Project Structure
- `index.html` - Main HTML structure
- `styles.css` - All styling and responsive design rules
